# Contact Form Setup Guide

## 🎯 Where Project Details Go

When users submit contact forms (either "Send Project Details" or "Send Email"), here's what happens:

### 1. **Development Mode (Current Setup)**
- ✅ **Console Logs**: All form submissions are logged to the server console with full details
- ✅ **Structured Data**: Name, email, message, project type, budget, timeline
- ✅ **Easy to Monitor**: Check your terminal/server logs to see new submissions

### 2. **Production Mode (With Email Service)**
To receive emails instead of console logs, add a RESEND_API_KEY to your environment:

```bash
# Add to .env.local file
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
```

**What happens with Resend configured:**
- 📧 **Emails sent to**: `syedmirhabib@gmail.com`
- 📧 **Professional formatting**: HTML emails with project details
- 📧 **Reply-to setup**: Easy to respond directly to the client
- 📧 **Fallback protection**: Still logs to console if email fails

## 🛠️ How to Monitor Submissions

### During Development:
1. Keep your terminal/console open where you run `npm run dev`
2. Watch for log entries that start with "📧 NEW CONTACT FORM SUBMISSION"
3. All form data will be clearly displayed with separators

### In Production:
1. Set up a Resend account (https://resend.com)
2. Get your API key
3. Add it to your environment variables
4. Emails will be sent automatically to `syedmirhabib@gmail.com`

## 🎨 Form Locations

1. **Main Contact Page**: `/contact` - Full detailed form
2. **Quick Contact Button**: Floating button (appears on all pages)
3. **Call-to-Action Section**: Homepage - "Start Your Project" button
4. **Schedule Page**: `/schedule` - Quick WhatsApp booking option

## ⚡ Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
node test-contact-api.js
```

This will simulate form submissions and show you exactly what data is being processed.
